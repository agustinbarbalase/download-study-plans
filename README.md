# download-study-plans

## Description

I am an engineering student and I wanted to download all the study plans of all my subjects, so I made a code for an automatic download :)

I study at [FIUBA](http://www.fi.uba.ar/), so if you are also a FIUBA student, use this code to download all the study plans for all your subjects. Check the [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions) section.

## Resources
